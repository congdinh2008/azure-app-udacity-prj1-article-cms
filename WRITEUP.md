## Analysis:

### Costs:
- VM: VMs typically require upfront costs for hardware, software licenses, and ongoing maintenance. Costs depend on the VM size and configuration chosen, and can vary widely.
- App Service: App Service offers a more cost-effective option, as it is a managed platform with no upfront costs for hardware or software licenses. Pricing is based on the chosen tier (e.g., Free, Basic, Standard, Premium) and the features required.
### Scalability:
- VM: VMs provide more flexibility in terms of scalability, as they can be configured with custom resources and can handle larger workloads. However, scaling requires manual intervention and may have downtime during scaling operations.
- App Service: App Service offers automatic scaling, where the platform can automatically adjust resources based on workload demands. This makes it easier to handle varying traffic loads without manual intervention.
### Availability:
- VM: VMs can provide high availability if configured in a clustered or load-balanced setup. However, it requires additional configuration and management to ensure high availability.
- App Service: App Service provides built-in high availability with automatic backups, patching, and load balancing. It also offers options for deployment slots, which allows for testing and staging before production deployment.
### Workflow:
- VM: VMs require more manual setup and configuration, including installation and configuration of the operating system, web server, and other software. Deployment and management require more time and effort.
- App Service: App Service offers a simplified workflow, as it is a managed platform that handles most of the setup and configuration automatically. Deployment and management are easier and faster.

## Choice:

Based on the analysis, the appropriate solution for deploying the small CMS app would be App Service. App Service offers a cost-effective, scalable, and highly available option with a simplified workflow, making it easier and quicker to deploy and manage the app.

## Justification:

The App Service option is justified for the following reasons:

### Cost-effectiveness: 
App Service eliminates upfront costs for hardware and software licenses, making it a more cost-effective option for CMS app deployment.
### Scalability: 
App Service offers automatic scaling, which allows for handling varying traffic loads without manual intervention, making it a more scalable option.
### Availability: 
App Service provides built-in high availability with automatic backups, patching, and load balancing, ensuring a reliable and available environment for the app.
### Workflow: 
App Service simplifies the deployment and management workflow, making it easier and quicker to deploy and manage the app.

## App changes that would change the decision:

If the CMS app requires custom configurations, custom software installations, or specific OS-level access, a VM solution may be more suitable. For example, if the app requires access to low-level system resources, specialized hardware, or custom networking configurations, a VM solution would provide more flexibility.

To change the decision, the app and other needs would have to change to require specific configurations or access that cannot be achieved through the managed platform of App Service. This could include custom software installations, custom networking configurations, or specialized hardware requirements.

In summary, based on the analysis of costs, scalability, availability, and workflow, App Service is the appropriate solution for deploying the CMS app. However, specific app requirements and needs may necessitate a VM solution if custom configurations or access to low-level system resources is required.
